# UFOs

## Overview of Project </br>
The purpose of this project was to put together a webpage where people can filter UFO sightings data. The webpage was originally put together with only the date being a filter set, but it was discovered that we could add additional filters (city, state, country and shape) to the webpage in order to narrow down more specifically.</br>

## Results </br>
Someone could use this webpage by filtering UFO data by certain peramiters such as date, city, state, country and shape of UFO signting. If someone needed to look up UFO sightings in Cleveland, Ohio, they can do so with ease.

They can further narrow down their search by putting in a specific date or shape.

## Summary </br>

One drawback of this new design is that you are limited on what you can really play around with on the filters. You are very limited to only having the date, city, state, country and shape. I list two improvements below on what might help with this.

Two improvements I would recommend making to the page is adding a general keyword search to the filter box. A keyword box can help people search for specific verbiage in the UFO sighting descriptions that you might not be able to find by using date, city, state, country or shape filters. 

One more improvement I would suggest is to have a way to make the filters hold multiple inputs. For example, if you would like to search all UFO sightings on 01/20/2010 and 02/05/2013 in the cities of Des Moines and Tuscon, you could do that in one search rather than running two seperate searches.
